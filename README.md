# layout_optimisation
Work done on the Raman Project at Sacha Engineering:
Note that the choice of words "Master" and "Slave" is just for terminology purposes in the code. 
It has nothing to do with actual slavery, which is strongly discouraged by the author.

Remaining issues to be solved:
1. Writing a program for populating the required data structures which adapts to the problem at hand suitably.
2. Dealing with the case where multiple branches of lengths more than one meet at a particular master.

Feel free to contribute to the existing code by creating a pull request!
